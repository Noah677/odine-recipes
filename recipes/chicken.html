    <h1>Fried Chicken Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (thighs and drumsticks work well)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the flour, salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper to create the coating mixture.</li>
        <li>Dip each chicken piece into the buttermilk, allowing excess liquid to drain off.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken pieces with the seasoned flour mixture, pressing the coating onto the chicken to adhere.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the coated chicken pieces to the hot oil, skin-side down.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken for about 5-6 minutes per side, or until the coating is golden brown and the chicken is cooked through (the internal temperature should reach 165°F or 74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chicken from the skillet and place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy your delicious fried chicken!</li>
    </ol>
